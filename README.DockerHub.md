Docker container to feed ADS-B data into [adsbexchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com). Designed to work in tandem with [sdr-enthusiasts/readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf) or another BEAST provider. Builds and runs on x86, x86_64, arm32v7 & arm64v8.

The container pulls ADS-B information from a BEAST provider and sends data to [adsbexchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com).

For more information on [adsbexchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com), see here: [ADSBExchange How-To-Feed](https://adsbexchange.com/how-to-feed/). This container uses a modified version of the "script method" outlined on that page.
