Docker container to feed ADS-B data into [adsbexchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com). Designed to work in tandem with [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf][docker-readsb-protobuf] or another BEAST provider. Builds and runs on x86, x86_64, arm32v7 & arm64v8.

The container pulls ADS-B information from a BEAST provider and sends data to [adsbexchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com).

For more information on [adsbexchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com), see here: [ADSBExchange How-To-Feed](https://adsbexchange.com/how-to-feed/). This container uses a modified version of the "script method" outlined on that page.

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` is built from the [`main` branch](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbexchange/tree/main) within 24 hours of a commit to the base image and/or any adsbexchange software included in the image. It contains:
  * Versions of `mlat-client` and `readsb` specified in [adsbxchange/adsb-exchange/setup.sh](https://github.com/adsbxchange/adsb-exchange/blob/master/setup.sh)
  * Latest version of `adsbexchange-stats`
  * Latest released version of `rtl-sdr`
* `latest_nohealthcheck` is the same as the `latest` version above. However, this version has the docker healthcheck removed. This is done for people running platforms (such as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io)) that don't support manually disabling healthchecks, where healthchecks are not wanted.
* Specific version and architecture tags are available if required, however these are not regularly updated. It is generally recommended to run `latest`.

## Configuring `sdr-enthusiasts/adsbexchange` Container

* If you're using this container with the [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf][docker-readsb-protobuf] container to provide ModeS/BEAST data, and the containers are on different docker networks or on different hosts:
  * You'll need to ensure you've opened port `30005` (or whatever port is serving BEAST data) into the [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf][docker-readsb-protobuf] container.
  * The IP address or hostname of the docker host running the [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf][docker-readsb-protobuf] container should be passed to the `sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbexchange` container via the `BEASTHOST` environment variable shown below. The port can be changed from the default of `30005` with the optional `BEASTPORT` environment variable if required.
* The latitude and longitude of your antenna must be passed via the `LAT` and `LONG` environment variables respectively.
* The altitude of your antenna must be passed via the `ALT` environment variable respectively. Defaults to metres, but units may specified with a 'ft' or 'm' suffix.
* A UUID for this feeder must be passed via the `UUID` environment variable (see below).
* Lastly, you should specify a site name via the `SITENAME` environment variable. This field supports letters, numbers, `-` & `_` only. Any other characters will be stripped upon container initialization.

## Generating a site UUID Number

First-time users should generate a static UUID using this command:


```shell
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid
```

Take note of the UUID returned. You should pass it as the `UUID` environment variable when running the container.

You will be able to view your site's stats by visiting `https://www.adsbexchange.com/api/feeders/?feed=YOUR-UUID-HERE`. The link with your UUID will be printed to the container log when the container starts.

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name adsbx \
 -e TZ=YOUR_TIMEZONE \
 -e BEASTHOST=beasthost \
 -e LAT=-33.33333 \
 -e LONG=111.11111 \
 -e ALT=50m \
 -e SITENAME=My_Cool_ADSB_Receiver \
 -e UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
 --tmpfs=/run:rw,nosuid,nodev,exec,relatime,size=64M,uid=1000,gid=1000 \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbexchange:latest
```

## Up-and-Running with Docker Compose

First timers are encouraged to read [ADS-B Reception, Decoding & Sharing with Docker](https://mikenye.gitbook.io/ads-b/).

An example docker compose service definition is below:

```yaml
  adsbexchange:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsbexchange:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: adsbx
    restart: always
    environment:
      - BEASTHOST=beasthost
      - TZ=Australia/Perth
      - LAT=-33.33333
      - LONG=111.11111
      - ALT=50m
      - SITENAME=My_Cool_ADSB_Receiver
      - UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    tmpfs:
      - /run:rw,nosuid,nodev,exec,relatime,size=64M,uid=1000,gid=1000
```

## Runtime Environment Variables

There are a series of available environment variables:
